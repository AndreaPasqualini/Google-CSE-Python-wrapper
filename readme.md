# Python wrapper for Google's CSE

This python program uses the Google API for the Custom Search Engine product.
I coded this for a research assistance job.

The goal of the program is to take a list of strings to be searched using Google's search engine and return a database listing the URLs associated to each search.
If you plan to use this in conjunction with Google's paid plan, then note my program is capable of splitting the whole job in order to schedule 10k searches every 24 hours.

Information about Google's API can be found at its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client), on [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) and on [Python's Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-api-python-client/).
Obviously, the package `google-api-python-client` is a hard dependency of my code.

Please note, I did not specifically aim at computational efficiency when I coded this thing.
Therefore, there is space for performance improvement.
